      >Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
      describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
      such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
      alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p
    >
    <p style="color: lightblue"
      ><span style="font-style: italic">CSS</span> stands for
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Cascading Style Sheets</span> CSS is
      designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including
      layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content
      accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification
      of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share
      formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which
      reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as
      enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between
      the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p
    >
    <p style="color: yellow"
      ><span style="font-style: italic">CSS</span> Separation of formatting and
      content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in
      different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in
      print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on
      Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting
      if the content is accessed on a mobile device.</p

    <p style="color: yellowgreen"
      >The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine
      which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular
      element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.</p
